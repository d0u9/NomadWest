            I am a software engineer focusing on systems programming and open source development. I am passionate about exploring new technologies while also enjoying photography as a way to capture life's beautiful moments.

        <p>
            Currently based in Seattle, I spend my free time hiking and taking photos. Capturing the grandeur of nature and the vibrancy of city life through my lens is one of my greatest passions.

            My programming journey began during my university years. I was captivated by computer science, particularly operating systems and low-level system programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Photography became part of my life in 2018. What started as casual phone photography gradually evolved into a dedicated hobby. I particularly enjoy capturing natural landscapes, especially sunsets and starry skies.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website serves as a chronicle of my exploration and growth in both technology and photography. I hope to share my experiences and work through this platform.
